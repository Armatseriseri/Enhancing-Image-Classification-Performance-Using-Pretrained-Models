# Enhancing-Image-Classification-Performance-Using-Pretrained-Models
Baseline Model Development: Implement a baseline model using a pretrained architecture such as MobileNetV2 to establish a foundational performance benchmark. This model focuses on utilizing the feature extraction capabilities of the pretrained network while minimally modifying the architecture to suit the classification task.
